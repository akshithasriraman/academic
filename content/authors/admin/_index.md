# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a computer systems researcher. My research interests are in the areas of computer architecture and systems software, focusing on designing efficient hyperscale web systems.

    My research improves the performance, cost, and energy efficiency of hyperscale web services. Current web service systems introduce trade-offs between performance and numerous features essential for cost- and energy-efficient operation of data centers (e.g., high server utilization, continuous power management, and use of commodity hardware and software). Specifically, I have designed and implemented practical and scalable systems that improve service performance across the system stack, without sacrificing cost- and energy-efficiency in modern hyperscale web systems.

    I am a recipient of the Facebook Fellowship (Distributed Systems), a UIUC Rising Stars in EECS Workshop participant, and a recipient of the Rackham Graduate Fellowship. My work has resulted in multiple research papers at top-tier computer architecture and systems venues like OSDI, ISCA, and ASPLOS.
